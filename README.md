# SYSC2100-Sorting-Algo-Running-Times-Assignment
Short script made for assignment 3 for SYSC2100 during WINTER 2021 because I didn't feel like manually making data tables and graphs for the report.

Runs some sorting algorithms with various list inputs incrementing in size, and outputs the number of swaps and comparisons using excel and matplotlib plot.

Changing the hard-coded arguments to the TestComplexity object initialization let you change the max list size, list size increment, the sorting functions to test for, and their names (I did not know of the existence of .__name__ back when I wrote this).

NOTE: I did not write the sorting algorithms. That was given to us by the professor.
